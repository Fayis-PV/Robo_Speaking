# Robo_Speaking

This a Robo developed by Muhammed Fayis PV which speaks the text which it is given.

This Robo is speaking using pyttsx3 module.
This is functioned to enter a text and submit the text,
Then Robo will pronounce for you.

You can install the module using:
In Mac:
```
pip3 install pyttsx3 
```

In Windows:
```
pip install pyttsx3
```

This is developed using while loop which continues the practice until you break the loop
So you can break the loop by simply typing the letter 'q' when asks to enter the text.

This is a small project which is developed for practice
Thanks...
